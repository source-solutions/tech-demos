This wiki is the single-source for the following SE Basic IV documents:

* HELP app
* [project wiki](https://github.com/source-solutions/HELP/wiki)
* [printed manual](https://github.com/source-solutions/HELP/blob/main/Programming%20SE%20Basic%20IV.pdf)

Content is componentized, written in a hybrid of Markdown and HTML, and formatted for an 80x24 fixed-width character display.

The wiki repository includes a makefile to build the PDF. This requires these command line tools:

* [LaTeX](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
