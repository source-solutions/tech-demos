### ELSE
***
<code><b>ELSE</b> [<var>anything</var>]</code>

Unless part of an [`IF`](IF) statement on the same line, anything after `ELSE` is 
ignored in the same way as after `'` or <code>:[REM](REM)</code>. Unlike Microsoft BASIC, a colon
(`:`) preceding the `ELSE` statement is required. However, if you enter a space
before `ELSE` the tokenizer will add the colon for you. See <code>[IF](IF)</code> for normal usage.
