## Functions
***
_Functions_ can only be used as part of an expression within a statement; they may take input values between parentheses and produce a return value. For example, in `PRINT ABS(-1)` the `ABS` function is used in an expression within a `PRINT` statement; in `Y = SQR(X) + 2` the `SQR` function is used in an expression within a `LET` statement.

For some function, including those that do not take an input, parentheses are optional. However, for maximum compatibility you may want to include them anyway.
