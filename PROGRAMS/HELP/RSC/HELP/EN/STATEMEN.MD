## Statements
***
A program line is composed of a line number and one or more statements. If multiple statements are put on one line, they must be separated by colons (`:`). Statements may be empty. Each statement has its own idiosyncratic syntax.

Many reference works distinguish commands and statements; this distinction stems from the original Dartmouth design of the BASIC language, in which commands were not part of the language and could not be used in programs, but were rather used to control the interpreter itself. However, in SE Basic IV this distinction is less useful and therefore this reference includes what is traditionally thought of as commands in the category of statements.
