This macOS binary of SCRplus is based on version 0.21 by Edward Cree:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/scrplus/

With modifications by Tomaz Solc:

https://github.com/avian2/scrplus/

And further modifications as described here:

https://github.com/source-solutions/sebasic4/wiki/Developer-guide#Encode-SCR-images

Note: The output format for Timex images is MLT. The attributes must be converted to SCR order to display the image.

Original content of the README file follows:


Dependencies: SDL, SDL_image.
Optional (required for GUI): gtk+-2.0.
Optional (Image types): libpng, zlib, jpeg, libtiff.
If you're compiling from source, you'll probably need the development versions of some of these libraries too.

To compile: 'make'.

To convert to SCR: ./scrplus [-s] [options] < infile > outfile.scr

To convert to BMP: ./scrplus -b [options] < infile > outfile.bmp

To convert to ZXP: ./scrplus -z [options] < infile > outfile.zxp

To open the GUI: ./gscrplus, or just double-click on gscrplus in your graphical file manager

How It Works (if at all): See file 'algorithm'.

Options/Switches:
+U			activate ULAplus render mode
+t			activate Timex hi-colour render mode
+bw			activate black&white render mode
-i=infile	input file (mainly for Doze compat)
-o=outfile	output file (ditto)
-f			deactivate "dither fix"
-p=palfile	use the palette in palfile (may be a (TAP) Palette or a 64-byte raw file) instead of generating one
-c=mask		use only the CLUTs selected in mask (a single nonzero hex digit.  eg. -c=A means use only CLUTs 1 and 3).  Default is F, ie. all CLUTs used
-c=mask,use	only the CLUTs in mask may be written to, while those in use may be used to render the image
-Vshift=va	\
-Vscale=vb	|
-Sshift=sa	| HSV 'tweaks'; adjust the range and balance of the Hue, Saturation and Value channels.  Defaults are all 128
-Sscale=sb	|
-Hshift=h	/
-e=depress	adjust the palette variation (how much to de-want neighbouring yuvs when choosing a palent?).  Default is 0
--scale		scale X and Y independently (default)	\
--crop		scale up keeping aspect ratio, and crop	| Sizer - select how to handle images with a different aspect ratio to the output
--zoom		scale down keeping aspect ratio			/
-w=width	set the width to scale to  \ gives you an output screen part of which is blank
-h=height	set the height to scale to / originally for use by SCV/anicom
